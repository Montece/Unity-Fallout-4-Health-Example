+ Line movement and related parameters
+ Added Monochromatic Unobstructed shader (visible through other objects)

* Fixed wrong material applied in the bump diffuse demo scene
* Combined two shaders: PBR (metallic workflow) (with roughness map) shader and PBR (metallic workflow) (with smoothness map) shader into one PBR (metallic workflow) shader
* Renamed 'Bump Diffuse' shader to 'Diffuse Bump' to have this shader type grouped in the shader dropdown menu together with the 'Diffuse' shader

*** v1.1 (2016/02/13) ***
